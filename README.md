OWL strict SHACL shapes and ontology examples

- ontology_repair_shapes.ttl are SHACL shapes to check conformance with OWL strict syntactic restrictions.
- the SHACL shapes were used as an input to [SHACL repairs](https://github.com/robert-david/shacl-repairs) to transform ontology RDF graphs into conformant versions.
- Examples contain ontologies in i) original version and ii) in an OWL strict conformant version (repaired).
- Conformant versions were verified with [SHACL validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/any/upload).
